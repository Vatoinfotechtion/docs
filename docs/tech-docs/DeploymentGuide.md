## I-ARM Deployment Guide

The Deployment of the end-to-end I-ARM product will occur in several phases, as outlined below:

1. Pre-Infrastructure Deployment
2. Infrastructure Deployment
3. Module Configuration
4. Solution Deployment
5. Manual Configurations

## Pre-Infrastructure Deployment

The pre-infrastructure guide is essential as it outlines the necessary steps to create a Microsoft Entra ID Security Group, configure the service account, register the application, assign permissions, generate secrets or create certificates, and expose APIs. These actions are crucial for ensuring a secure and properly configured environment for the deployment and operation of your services.

Download the i-ARM deployment runbook from this link [i-ARM\_Runbook.xlsx](DeploymentGuideImages/i-ARM_Runbook.xlsx) for an easy tracking of your deployment activities.

### Register Resource Providers

Azure Resource Providers are services in Azure that allow you to create and manage resources in your Azure subscription. Each resource provider offers a set of resource types that can be deployed and managed.

The below resource providers need to be registered in your Azure subscription before we can create i-ARM resources associated with them.

**Note**: To register resource providers in Azure, the user needs to have the **Owner** or **Contributor** role on the subscription.

Steps to Register a Resource Provider:

1. **Log into Azure Portal**: Go to [Ref:](https://portal.azure.com) and log in.
2. **Go to Subscriptions**: In the Azure portal, search for Subscriptions in the search bar or go directly to Subscriptions under All Services.
3. **In the subscription blade**: Look for the "Resource providers" option in the settings menu.
4. **In the Resource providers pane**: You will see a list of available providers and their registration status.
