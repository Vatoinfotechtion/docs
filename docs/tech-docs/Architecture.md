# Architecture Overview

<span id="_Toc145519981" class="anchor"></span>The Bank’s physical
records and electronic records in FileSite are currently managed by
Autonomy Records Manager (ARM). This system provides the capability to
classify our records in line with the Bank’s Records Classification
Scheme (RCS) and to manage the retention and defensible disposition of
those records based on the retention policies specified in the RCS. It
also provides the location management of physical records. The
capabilities of ARM are being replaced by utilising the records
management capabilities of Microsoft Purview supplemented by i-ARM.
Electronic records (in CLOSED FileSite Folders) will be migrated to
SharePoint Online.

The document contains the details of the i-ARM offerings, which is a
comprehensive data and records management product. It provides the
high-level details of what will be required to implement i-ARM component
on the Banks Microsoft Azure production tenant.

The use of i-ARM is designed to enhance the Bank’s data governance and
compliance processes while ensuring seamless integration with M365
workloads and Purview. This solution leverages advanced capabilities to
provide organizations with complete visibility and control over their
data assets.

This high level design covers the necessary design for the
implementation for the i-ARM component and covers the following aspects
for the design:

- Th implementation of the i-ARM component on the Banks Tenant IaaS and
  PaaS infrastructure

- The connectivity of the i-ARM component through to the Banks M365
  Tenant – SPO and Purview

- The DevOps pipeline for updates for the i-ARM components from
  Infotechtion environment

- The implementation of the Online Reporting Platform for i-ARM.

- It does not cover other aspects which will be required for the
  completion of the project, such as:

- The connectivity back to on-premise required for the migration of
  documents

- The on-going movement of documents from on-premise ARM and FileSite to
  i-ARM and SPO as records close on ARM

- I Information Architecture for the structure of the target solution
  within SharePoint Online

- The actual migration process

- Integration with the Banks implementation of Preservuica for the
  digital preservation of documents.

As such it is a platform design, further high-level designs will need to
be produced to inform on these aspects above at a later date. The
production of these designs will need to be scheduled and planned.

Note that the Architecture Brief for this ARM Replacement project deals
with the on-premise infrastructure which is required for the migration
tool Proventeq. This is to enable the discovery and the extraction of
the data from Filesite and ARM. We will extend this HLD to include the
design and implementation necessary to enable the migration of documents
to M365.

### Data Flow Diagram

The logical data flow diagram shows how data moves through the i-ARM
system.

<img src="./ArchitectureImages/image9.png" style="width:7.04126in;height:9.10843in"
alt="A diagram of a computer Description automatically generated" />


The section below explains the general flow of the data within i-ARM

1.  User requests for login

    - Action: The user opens the i-ARM portal in their browser and
      inputs their login credentials issued by Microsoft 365 Tenant.

    - System Response: The credentials are sent to the WebApp, which
      forwards them to the Authentication service for verification.

2.  User Successfully Authenticates and Logs into i-ARM Portal

    - Action: The Authentication service (Azure AD) verifies the u’er's
      credentials.

    - System Response: If the credentials are valid, the user is granted
      access to the i-ARM portal, and the WebApp redirects the user to
      the home page.

3.  Disposal Dashboard Page Requests Web API to Get Disposable Items

    - Action: The user navigates to the Disposal Dashboard page within
      the i-ARM portal.

    - System Response: The WebApp sends a request to the Web API to
      retrieve a list of disposable items from the Database.

4.  Disposable Items are Visible in Grid View

    - Action: The Web API retrieves the list of disposable items from
      the Database.

    - System Response: The Web API returns the data to the WebApp, which
      displays the items in a grid view on the Disposal Dashboard page.

5.  User Performs Various Disposal Operations on Listed Items

    - Action: The user interacts with the grid to perform various
      disposal operations. The available operations include:

    - Dispose Items: The user selects one or more items and marks them
      for disposal.

      - Extend Retention Period: The user selects items and changes
        their retention period to a later date.

      - Re-Label/Change Retention Label: The user changes the retention
        label of selected items.

      - Archive Items: The user archives selected items for long-term
        storage.

    - System Response: Each operation sends a request to the Web API,
      which interacts with the Database to update the status of the
      items based on the u’er's actions.

6.  User Requests Reports

    - Action: The user selects the Reports option in the i-ARM portal
      and specifies the type of report they need.

    - System Response: The WebApp sends a request to Power BI to
      generate the required report. Power BI retrieves the necessary
      data from the Database and processes it to generate the report,
      which is then returned to the WebApp and displayed to the user.

7.  PA Flow: The section below describes the Power Automate Flows
    deployed as a part of the i-ARM system deployment within BoE Power
    Automate Environment.

    - Disposal Actions Flow: This flow gets triggered daily, it picks
      items disposed or relabelled from i-ARM portal. Fetched item(s)
      details are sent to MS Purview for disposition/ re-labelling and
      Database is updated with proper status to keep track.

    - Business Reviewers Disposition: This is triggered when an item
      reaches the end of its retention period. It retrieves to be
      disposed item details by making request to respective SharePoint
      site. Retrieved data or items details are inserted into database.
      Once it is inserted in database its available for disposition from
      i-ARM portal.

    - Business and Archive Reviewers: Flow is same as Business Reviewers
      Disposition, with the only difference being that an item requires
      an Archive Reviewer User for disposing an item.

    - Compliance Sync: This is Power Automate flow which will
      synchronise Retention Labels from MS Purview and insert details of
      retention label into database.

8.  Physical Records Management:

- **SPFx Module:** This module is a SharePoint solution which handles
  creation and management of Physical Records.

  - User requests login.

    - Action: User opens the browser and inputs their login credentials
      issued by Microsoft 365 Tenant.

    - System Response: The credentials are authenticated by M365’s
      authentication mechanism and the user are logged in.

  - Login request to SharePoint authentication mechanism.

    - Action: User credentials are passed on to M365 Tenant’s own
      authentication mechanism.

    - System Response: User is authenticated from Microsoft’s end.

  - After successful login user will request access to SharePoint

    - Action: After successful log in users will need to request for
      SharePoint site/pages where our solution is deployed if they do
      not have the access already.

    - System Response: Users will then be able to view all the search
      pages and pages where custom forms are implemented.

  - User interacts with SharePoint via custom search pages and forms
    which are designed.

    - Action: User may try to perform any of operations which are
      search, create, edit, view physical records using our solution.

    - System Response: Solution will respond accordingly based on the
      operations performed.

      - Search operation will return search results.

      - Create operation will return display form with created entry.

      - Edit operation will return display form with edited entries.

      - View operation will return display form with relevant details.

- **Bulk Import:** This module is a background process which creates
  physical records based on the records added in csv format.

  - Timer trigger function runs after every interval to pick input file
    for processing.

    - Action: Request to authenticate using AAD certificate.

    - System Response: On successful response, access token is returned
      to the background process.

  - Requests for input file to process.

    - Action: After getting access token, process checks SharePoint list
      for input file.

    - Response: Returns files whose status is “New.”

  - Start processing the input file.

    - Action: Once the input file is received, system starts processing
      the data and creates records in SharePoint list.

    - Response: Returns the response message of success/fail while
      creating records.

  <!-- -->

  - The i-ARM solution leverages capabilities of the PnP framework i.e.
    specifically the PnP search web part to provide search functionality
    within the physical records management feature.

| New | Disposal reviews | i-ARM feature ‘My disposal dashboard’ will require new skills for existing records management team to operationally manage the disposal activities related to physical and digital records. | Existing disposal process will be configured in the target architecture. |

### Service Levels

The following table is for request service levels.

| Category | Priority | Response target | Resolution target | Applicable hours\* |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Standard | Medium | 4 hours | 3 days | Mon-Fri 8:00 am till 5:00 pm excluding public holidays local to customer’s regional time zones |
| Standard | Low | 4 hours | 5 days | Mon-Fri 8:00 am till 5:00 pm excluding public holidays local to customer’s regional time zones |
| Non-Standard | Medium | 4 hours | 7 days\*\* | Mon-Fri 8:00 am till 5:00 pm excluding public holidays local to customer’s regional time zones |
| Non-Standard | Low | 8 hours | As per roadmap timeline, earliest the following quarter. | Mon-Fri 8:00 am till 5:00 pm excluding public holidays local to customer’s regional time zones |

\* Custom hours as per customer requirements to be agreed with
additional costs. These are outlined in the pricing section.

\*\* Subject to the complexity of service request, these could require
additional days. In such cases, the overall delivery can be split in
sprints of 7 days.

### Testability

\[Describe at a high level (in a few lines) the approach suggested for
testing considering operability, observability, controllability
decomposability, simplicity, stability and understand ability. This
section should also include suggested types of testing by the
architecture such as function testing, non-functional testing
(resilience, performance, load, security, volume, recovery etc.)\]

modular nature allows for flexibility and agility, enabling rapid
development and deployment.

- Operability:

  - The architecture primarily leverages Az’re's PaaS services, which
    offer high operability due to their managed nature.

  - DevOps & Release Pipelines ensure smooth CI/CD, providing automated
    deployment and version control.

  - The Azure VM Data Gateway allows secure data transfer between Power
    BI and firewall protected services e.g. SQL Azure database,
    enhancing operational flexibility.

- Observability:

  - Instrumentation Services are built into the architecture to monitor
    application health, performance, and metrics.

  - Azure Monitor and Application Insights can be used to collect
    telemetry data from Azure Web App, Function Apps, providing insights
    into application behaviour.

  - Logs and metrics are easily accessible, enabling quick detection and
    diagnosis of issues.

- Controllability:

  - The architecture implements Azure Key Vault and Managed Identities
    for secure authentication and authorization control.

  - The use of Azure Policy and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures
    fine-grained control over resource access.

  - Azure VNET provides network isolation and security controls at the
    network level.

- Decomposability:

  - The architecture is modular, with distinct services such as Azure
    Functions and Web App, each handling specific workloads.

  - A few services operate independently, enabling isolated development,
    testing, and deployment.

  - Services can be updated or replaced independently without affecting
    the entire system.

- Simplicity:

  - Azure PaaS services abstract much of the underlying infrastructure
    complexity, simplifying the architecture.

  - The logical separation of services (Functions, Web App) makes it
    easy to understand and manage the application.

  - Using managed services like Azure SQL Database and Azure Key Vault
    reduces the need for custom configurations.

- Stability:

  - Az’re's managed services ensure high availability and redundancy
    configuration options, contributing to the stability of the
    architecture.

  - The modular design allows for graceful degradation if a particular
    service experiences issues, minimizing impact on the overall system.

  - Automated pipelines ensure consistent, tested deployments, reducing
    the risk of configuration drift.

- Understandability:

  - The architecture is well-documented and logically laid out, making
    it easy for teams to understand the flow of data and dependencies.

  - Standardized components like Azure Functions, and Web App are
    familiar to most teams, reducing the learning curve.

Additionally, the section below addresses the aspects of function
testing and non-functional testing (resilience, performance, load,
security, volume, recovery, etc.) of the i-ARM. Note that since i-ARM is
a product offering, the functional and non-functional tests specified
below has been performed in the Infotechtion’s internal environment.

- Function Testing:

  - Unit Testing: Each component, such as Azure Functions and Web App,
    have been unit tested to validate their individual functionalities.

  - Integration Testing: i-ARM team has validated interactions between
    components like the Web ’pp's interaction with the Azure SQL
    Database orchestration with Functions.

  - End-to-End Testing: Ensured the entire workflow from data input to
    final output works as expected, including interactions with external
    services like Power BI and Microsoft 365.

- Non-Functional Testing:

  - Resilience Testing:

    - i-ARM team has simulated failures in individual components like
      Azure Functions to ensure the system can handle faults gracefully.

  - Performance Testing:

    - The product team has done the benchmarking the response times of
      critical services like the Web App and Functions to ensure they
      meet performance requirements.

    - Testing the latency and throughput of Azure SQL Database to
      guarantee fast data access has been validated.

  - Load Testing:

    - Stress testing the Web App and Functions under high loads to
      assess their scalability has been performed.

  - Security Testing:

    - Penetration testing the entire architecture to identify potential
      vulnerabilities has been completed by a third-party service
      provider.

  - Volume Testing:

    - Testing the sys’em's capability to handle large volumes of data,
      especially focusing on Azure SQL Database has been completed.

    - Simulating high traffic scenarios to verify the Web ’pp's ability
      to handle large user volumes has been completed.

  - Recovery Testing:

    - Testing backup and restore processes for Azure SQL Database to
      ensure data recovery in case of failure has been verified.

### Cost Optimization 

This section outlines the cost optimization strategies employed in the
design and deployment of i-ARM, which utilizes Azure and SharePoint as
its primary platforms.

The solution components involved include Azure Function Apps, Azure Web
Apps, Azure Virtual Networking, Azure SQL Database, Azure VMs with
on-premises gateway installed, Power Automate Flows, and Azure Storage
Accounts.

The approach ensures that all components are deployed in accordance with
Microsoft's best practices and leverages recommendations from Azure
Advisor to achieve optimal cost efficiency.

**Components and Cost Optimization Techniques:**

- Azure Function Apps

  - Serverless Architecture

  - Scaling: Implement auto-scaling to handle varying loads efficiently
    and avoid over-provisioning.

  - Code Optimization: Optimize code to reduce execution time and
    resource consumption.

- Azure Web Apps

  - App Service Plan: Choose the appropriate App Service Plan based on
    expected traffic and performance requirements.

  - Scaling: Use auto-scaling rules to dynamically adjust resources
    based on demand.

- Azure SQL Database

  - Service Tiers: Select the appropriate service tier based on
    performance requirements.

- Azure VMs with On-Premises Gateway Installed

  - Right-Sizing: Choose the appropriate VM size based on workload
    requirements to avoid over-provisioning.

  - Reserved Instances: Purchase reserved instances for predictable
    workloads to benefit from discounted rates.

  - Shutdown Schedules: Implement automated shutdown schedules for
    non-critical VMs during off-hours.

- Azure Storage Accounts

  - Storage Tiers: Utilize different storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive)
    based on access patterns to optimize costs.

  - Lifecycle Management: Implement lifecycle management policies to
    automatically transition data to lower-cost storage tiers.

  - Redundancy Options: Choose the appropriate redundancy option (LRS,
    GRS, RA-GRS) based on data availability requirements and cost
    considerations.

- Power Automate Flows

  - Efficient Design: Design flows to minimize the number of actions and
    reduce execution time.

  - Trigger Optimization: Use appropriate triggers to avoid unnecessary
    flow executions.

  - Licensing: Select the right licensing plan based on usage patterns
    and requirements.

- Azure Advisor: Cloud operations team to regularly review Azure Advisor
  recommendations to identify cost-saving opportunities and implement
  suggested optimizations.

- Monitoring and Alerts: i-ARM will setup up the monitoring and alerts
  to track resource usage and costs, allowing for proactive management
  and adjustments.

- Resource Tagging: i-ARM to implement the resource tagging to
  categorize and track costs by department, project, or environment as
  per the bank’s policies.

- Cost Management Tools: The cloud operations team to utilize Azure Cost
  Management and Billing tools to analyse spending patterns and forecast
  future costs.

### On-Premises Data Gateway vs IP Whitelisting

**Using On-Premises Data Gateway**

- **Pros**:

  - Enhanced Security: The on-premises data gateway ensures a secure
    connection between Power Platform and your SQL Azure database
    without exposing the database to the public internet.

  - Data Encryption: Data is encrypted during transmission, providing an
    additional layer of security.

  - Centralized Management: The gateway provides a centralized point for
    managing data connections and can be used for multiple data sources.

  - Support for Multiple Services: The gateway can be used not only for
    Power Automate but also for Power BI, Power Apps, and other services
    within the Power Platform ecosystem.

  - No IP Whitelisting Required: Since the gateway handles the
    connection, there is no need to manage and update IP whitelisting
    rules on SQL firewall.

- **Cons**:

  - Complex Setup: Setting up and configuring the on-premises data
    gateway may require assistance from IT and Infra teams.

  - Maintenance: The gateway requires ongoing maintenance, including
    updates and monitoring to ensure it remains operational.

  - Resource Consumption: The gateway runs on a local machine or server,
    which consumes local resources and may require additional hardware.

  - Latency: There might be increased latency due to the additional hop
    through the on-premises data gateway.

**Whitelisting IP Address Range - Power Platform Region**

- **Pros**:

  - Simpler Setup: Whitelisting the IP address range of the Power
    Automate region is simpler and quicker to implement compared to
    setting up a gateway.

  - No Additional Hardware: This approach does not require any
    additional hardware or software installation.

  - Direct Connection: The connection is more direct, potentially
    reducing latency compared to using an on-premises data gateway.

  - Less Maintenance: Once the IP addresses are whitelisted, there is
    minimal ongoing maintenance required.

- **Cons**:

  - Security Risks: Whitelisting a range of IP addresses exposes the
    database to potential security risks, as any service within that IP
    range can attempt to connect.

  - IP Address Changes: IP address ranges for cloud services can change,
    requiring regular updates to the whitelist to ensure continued
    connectivity.

  - Limited Control: You have less control over which specific services
    or users can access the database, increasing the risk of
    unauthorized access.

  - Region-Specific: This solution is region-specific, so if your Power
    Automate flows operate across multiple regions, you may need to
    manage multiple sets of IP ranges.

**Conclusion**:

- Infotechtion recommends to deploy on premises data gateway for secure
  connectivity with data sources, example SQL from Power BI Service.

The logical data flow diagram shows how data moves through the i-ARM
system.

<img src="./ArchitectureImages/image9.png" style="width:7.04126in;height:9.10843in"
alt="A diagram of a computer Description automatically generated" />

The section below explains the general flow of the data within i-ARM

1.  User requests for login

    - Action: The user opens the i-ARM portal in their browser and
      inputs their login credentials issued by Microsoft 365 Tenant.

    - System Response: The credentials are sent to the WebApp, which
      forwards them to the Authentication service for verification.

2.  User Successfully Authenticates and Logs into i-ARM Portal

    - Action: The Authentication service (Azure AD) verifies the u’er's
      credentials.

    - System Response: If the credentials are valid, the user is granted
      access to the i-ARM portal, and the WebApp redirects the user to
      the home page.

3.  Disposal Dashboard Page Requests Web API to Get Disposable Items

    - Action: The user navigates to the Disposal Dashboard page within
      the i-ARM portal.

    - System Response: The WebApp sends a request to the Web API to
      retrieve a list of disposable items from the Database.

4.  Disposable Items are Visible in Grid View

    - Action: The Web API retrieves the list of disposable items from
      the Database.

    - System Response: The Web API returns the data to the WebApp, which
      displays the items in a grid view on the Disposal Dashboard page.

5.  User Performs Various Disposal Operations on Listed Items

    - Action: The user interacts with the grid to perform various
      disposal operations. The available operations include:

    - Dispose Items: The user selects one or more items and marks them
      for disposal.

      - Extend Retention Period: The user selects items and changes
        their retention period to a later date.

      - Re-Label/Change Retention Label: The user changes the retention
        label of selected items.

      - Archive Items: The user archives selected items for long-term
        storage.

    - System Response: Each operation sends a request to the Web API,
      which interacts with the Database to update the status of the
      items based on the u’er's actions.

6.  User Requests Reports

    - Action: The user selects the Reports option in the i-ARM portal
      and specifies the type of report they need.

    - System Response: The WebApp sends a request to Power BI to
      generate the required report. Power BI retrieves the necessary
      data from the Database and processes it to generate the report,
      which is then returned to the WebApp and displayed to the user.

7.  PA Flow: The section below describes the Power Automate Flows
    deployed as a part of the i-ARM system deployment within BoE Power
    Automate Environment.

    - Disposal Actions Flow: This flow gets triggered daily, it picks
      items disposed or relabelled from i-ARM portal. Fetched item(s)
      details are sent to MS Purview for disposition/ re-labelling and
      Database is updated with proper status to keep track.

    - Business Reviewers Disposition: This is triggered when an item
      reaches the end of its retention period. It retrieves to be
      disposed item details by making request to respective SharePoint
      site. Retrieved data or items details are inserted into database.
      Once it is inserted in database its available for disposition from
      i-ARM portal.

    - Business and Archive Reviewers: Flow is same as Business Reviewers
      Disposition, with the only difference being that an item requires
      an Archive Reviewer User for disposing an item.

    - Compliance Sync: This is Power Automate flow which will
      synchronise Retention Labels from MS Purview and insert details of
      retention label into database.

8.  Physical Records Management:

- **SPFx Module:** This module is a SharePoint solution which handles
  creation and management of Physical Records.

  - User requests login.

    - Action: User opens the browser and inputs their login credentials
      issued by Microsoft 365 Tenant.

    - System Response: The credentials are authenticated by M365’s
      authentication mechanism and the user are logged in.

  - Login request to SharePoint authentication mechanism.

    - Action: User credentials are passed on to M365 Tenant’s own
      authentication mechanism.

    - System Response: User is authenticated from Microsoft’s end.

  - After successful login user will request access to SharePoint

    - Action: After successful log in users will need to request for
      SharePoint site/pages where our solution is deployed if they do
      not have the access already.

    - System Response: Users will then be able to view all the search
      pages and pages where custom forms are implemented.

  - User interacts with SharePoint via custom search pages and forms
    which are designed.

    - Action: User may try to perform any of operations which are
      search, create, edit, view physical records using our solution.

    - System Response: Solution will respond accordingly based on the
      operations performed.

      - Search operation will return search results.

      - Create operation will return display form with created entry.

      - Edit operation will return display form with edited entries.

      - View operation will return display form with relevant details.

- **Bulk Import:** This module is a background process which creates
  physical records based on the records added in csv format.

  - Timer trigger function runs after every interval to pick input file
    for processing.

    - Action: Request to authenticate using AAD certificate.

    - System Response: On successful response, access token is returned
      to the background process.

### Testability

\[Describe at a high level (in a few lines) the approach suggested for
testing considering operability, observability, controllability
decomposability, simplicity, stability and understand ability. This
section should also include suggested types of testing by the
architecture such as function testing, non-functional testing
(resilience, performance, load, security, volume, recovery etc.)\]

modular nature allows for flexibility and agility, enabling rapid
development and deployment.

- Operability:

  - The architecture primarily leverages Az’re's PaaS services, which
    offer high operability due to their managed nature.

  - DevOps & Release Pipelines ensure smooth CI/CD, providing automated
    deployment and version control.

  - The Azure VM Data Gateway allows secure data transfer between Power
    BI and firewall protected services e.g. SQL Azure database,
    enhancing operational flexibility.

- Observability:

  - Instrumentation Services are built into the architecture to monitor
    application health, performance, and metrics.

  - Azure Monitor and Application Insights can be used to collect
    telemetry data from Azure Web App, Function Apps, providing insights
    into application behaviour.

  - Logs and metrics are easily accessible, enabling quick detection and
    diagnosis of issues.

- Controllability:

  - The architecture implements Azure Key Vault and Managed Identities
    for secure authentication and authorization control.

  - The use of Azure Policy and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures
    fine-grained control over resource access.

  - Azure VNET provides network isolation and security controls at the
    network level.

- Decomposability:

  - The architecture is modular, with distinct services such as Azure
    Functions and Web App, each handling specific workloads.

  - A few services operate independently, enabling isolated development,
    testing, and deployment.

  - Services can be updated or replaced independently without affecting
    the entire system.

- Simplicity:

  - Azure PaaS services abstract much of the underlying infrastructure
    complexity, simplifying the architecture.

  - The logical separation of services (Functions, Web App) makes it
    easy to understand and manage the application.

  - Using managed services like Azure SQL Database and Azure Key Vault
    reduces the need for custom configurations.

- Stability:

  - Az’re's managed services ensure high availability and redundancy
    configuration options, contributing to the stability of the
    architecture.

  - The modular design allows for graceful degradation if a particular
    service experiences issues, minimizing impact on the overall system.

  - Automated pipelines ensure consistent, tested deployments, reducing
    the risk of configuration drift.

- Understandability:

  - The architecture is well-documented and logically laid out, making
    it easy for teams to understand the flow of data and dependencies.

  - Standardized components like Azure Functions, and Web App are
    familiar to most teams, reducing the learning curve.

Additionally, the section below addresses the aspects of function
testing and non-functional testing (resilience, performance, load,
security, volume, recovery, etc.) of the i-ARM. Note that since i-ARM is
a product offering, the functional and non-functional tests specified
below has been performed in the Infotechtion’s internal environment.

- Function Testing:

  - Unit Testing: Each component, such as Azure Functions and Web App,
    have been unit tested to validate their individual functionalities.

  - Integration Testing: i-ARM team has validated interactions between
    components like the Web ’pp's interaction with the Azure SQL
    Database orchestration with Functions.

  - End-to-End Testing: Ensured the entire workflow from data input to
    final output works as expected, including interactions with external
    services like Power BI and Microsoft 365.

- Non-Functional Testing:

  - Resilience Testing:

    - i-ARM team has simulated failures in individual components like
      Azure Functions to ensure the system can handle faults gracefully.

  - Performance Testing:

    - The product team has done the benchmarking the response times of
      critical services like the Web App and Functions to ensure they
      meet performance requirements.

    - Testing the latency and throughput of Azure SQL Database to
      guarantee fast data access has been validated.

  - Load Testing:

    - Stress testing the Web App and Functions under high loads to
      assess their scalability has been performed.

  - Security Testing:

    - Penetration testing the entire architecture to identify potential
      vulnerabilities has been completed by a third-party service
      provider.

  - Volume Testing:

    - Testing the sys’em's capability to handle large volumes of data,
      especially focusing on Azure SQL Database has been completed.

    - Simulating high traffic scenarios to verify the Web ’pp's ability
      to handle large user volumes has been completed.

  - Recovery Testing:

    - Testing backup and restore processes for Azure SQL Database to
      ensure data recovery in case of failure has been verified.

### Waivers

N/A - The product is deployed as a packaged solution within the
environment.

### Requirements Compliance

N/A - The product is deployed as a packaged solution within the
environment.

Infotechtion i-ARM has been chosen as an additional component for
Advanced Records Management in te areas of mass disposition reviews and
paper records management in-order to meet the Banks Recurd Management
requirements. All the Banks requirements should be met through the
implementation of i-ARM in those areas.

### Risks, Assumptions, Issues and Dependencies

Due to the packaged solution deployment approach of the i-ARM product,
the details highlighting the risk and impacts are documented in the
context as well as container architecture diagrams above.

### Cost Optimization 

This section outlines the cost optimization strategies employed in the
design and deployment of i-ARM, which utilizes Azure and SharePoint as
its primary platforms.

The solution components involved include Azure Function Apps, Azure Web
Apps, Azure Virtual Networking, Azure SQL Database, Azure VMs with
on-premises gateway installed, Power Automate Flows, and Azure Storage
Accounts.

The approach ensures that all components are deployed in accordance with
Microsoft's best practices and leverages recommendations from Azure
Advisor to achieve optimal cost efficiency.

**Components and Cost Optimization Techniques:**

- Azure Function Apps

  - Serverless Architecture

  - Scaling: Implement auto-scaling to handle varying loads efficiently
    and avoid over-provisioning.

  - Code Optimization: Optimize code to reduce execution time and
    resource consumption.

- Azure Web Apps

  - App Service Plan: Choose the appropriate App Service Plan based on
    expected traffic and performance requirements.

  - Scaling: Use auto-scaling rules to dynamically adjust resources
    based on demand.

- Azure SQL Database

  - Service Tiers: Select the appropriate service tier based on
    performance requirements.

- Azure VMs with On-Premises Gateway Installed

  - Right-Sizing: Choose the appropriate VM size based on workload
    requirements to avoid over-provisioning.

  - Reserved Instances: Purchase reserved instances for predictable
    workloads to benefit from discounted rates.

  - Shutdown Schedules: Implement automated shutdown schedules for
    non-critical VMs during off-hours.

- Azure Storage Accounts

  - Storage Tiers: Utilize different storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive)
    based on access patterns to optimize costs.

  - Lifecycle Management: Implement lifecycle management policies to
    automatically transition data to lower-cost storage tiers.

  - Redundancy Options: Choose the appropriate redundancy option (LRS,
    GRS, RA-GRS) based on data availability requirements and cost
    considerations.

- Power Automate Flows

  - Efficient Design: Design flows to minimize the number of actions and
    reduce execution time.

  - Trigger Optimization: Use appropriate triggers to avoid unnecessary
    flow executions.

  - Licensing: Select the right licensing plan based on usage patterns
    and requirements.

- Azure Advisor: Cloud operations team to regularly review Azure Advisor
  recommendations to identify cost-saving opportunities and implement
  suggested optimizations.

- Monitoring and Alerts: i-ARM will setup up the monitoring and alerts
  to track resource usage and costs, allowing for proactive management
  and adjustments.

- Resource Tagging: i-ARM to implement the resource tagging to
  categorize and track costs by department, project, or environment as
  per the bank’s policies.

- Cost Management Tools: The cloud operations team to utilize Azure Cost
  Management and Billing tools to analyse spending patterns and forecast
  future costs.

### On-Premises Data Gateway vs IP Whitelisting

**Using On-Premises Data Gateway**

- **Pros**:

  - Enhanced Security: The on-premises data gateway ensures a secure
    connection between Power Platform and your SQL Azure database
    without exposing the database to the public internet.

  - Data Encryption: Data is encrypted during transmission, providing an
    additional layer of security.

  - Centralized Management: The gateway provides a centralized point for
    managing data connections and can be used for multiple data sources.

  - Support for Multiple Services: The gateway can be used not only for
    Power Automate but also for Power BI, Power Apps, and other services
    within the Power Platform ecosystem.

  - No IP Whitelisting Required: Since the gateway handles the
    connection, there is no need to manage and update IP whitelisting
    rules on SQL firewall.

- **Cons**:

  - Complex Setup: Setting up and configuring the on-premises data
    gateway may require assistance from IT and Infra teams.

  - Maintenance: The gateway requires ongoing maintenance, including
    updates and monitoring to ensure it remains operational.

  - Resource Consumption: The gateway runs on a local machine or server,
    which consumes local resources and may require additional hardware.

  - Latency: There might be increased latency due to the additional hop
    through the on-premises data gateway.

**Whitelisting IP Address Range - Power Platform Region**

- **Pros**:

  - Simpler Setup: Whitelisting the IP address range of the Power
    Automate region is simpler and quicker to implement compared to
    setting up a gateway.

  - No Additional Hardware: This approach does not require any
    additional hardware or software installation.

  - Direct Connection: The connection is more direct, potentially
    reducing latency compared to using an on-premises data gateway.

  - Less Maintenance: Once the IP addresses are whitelisted, there is
    minimal ongoing maintenance required.

- **Cons**:

  - Security Risks: Whitelisting a range of IP addresses exposes the
    database to potential security risks, as any service within that IP
    range can attempt to connect.

  - IP Address Changes: IP address ranges for cloud services can change,
    requiring regular updates to the whitelist to ensure continued
    connectivity.

  - Limited Control: You have less control over which specific services
    or users can access the database, increasing the risk of
    unauthorized access.

  - Region-Specific: This solution is region-specific, so if your Power
    Automate flows operate across multiple regions, you may need to
    manage multiple sets of IP ranges.

**Conclusion**:

- Infotechtion recommends to deploy on premises data gateway for secure
  connectivity with data sources, example SQL from Power BI Service.
